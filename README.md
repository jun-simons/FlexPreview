# Flex Preview

*Test responsive websites with ease!*

Flex Preview is a VSCode Extension for easy mobile previews at any custom device resolution. It also supports multiple preset device resolutions in addition to custom scaling.

## Features

Flex Preview provides a simple and powerful way to test the responsiveness of your web applications directly within your editor.

### Live Preview with Interactive Controls

Instantly launch a preview panel with a convenient dropdown menu to switch between devices. This is perfect for local development servers (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) or viewing any live URL.

### Automatic Responsive Scaling

The device preview automatically and smoothly scales down to fit the available space in your editor panel. This allows you to test high-resolution tablet layouts without ever overflowing the screen, while the website inside renders at its true resolution.
